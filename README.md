# Manage multiple Kubernetes clusters with Terraform

This repo contains an example for creating two GKE clusters in Terraform and deploying an `nginx` deployment into either
of them.

## Deploy

To run this example, clone it locally and run

```
terraform init && terraform apply
```

The above will initialize terraform and apply it.
